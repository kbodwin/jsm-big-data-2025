[🌐 Blog](https://kbodwin.github.io/paRticles/). | **Dr. Kelly Bodwin** is an educator with over a decade of experience of teaching statistics and data science with R.  She has co-authored multiple R packages, including `flair` and `tidyclust`, and she is currently a consultant on an NSF Grant building infrastructure for the `data.table` package.  Her published applied research frequently involves manipulating large, in-memory data.  Examples include: performing large matrix computations on high-dimensional GWAS (genome-wide association studies) data; constructing temporal social networks at hundreds of time checkpoints for organizational membership data; and summarizing biodiversity metrics grouped over exhaustive permutations of taxa level organism counts and experimental conditions.  Above all, Dr. Bodwin’s educational goal is to lower barriers to entry for beginner and intermediate R users to benefit from modern tools and enable more efficient and effective data workflows.

They have been building data tooling for 15 years, including both R and Python data tools for scientific and data science computing. They are a member of the PMC for Apache Arrow, a maintainer of the Apache Arrow package, and the author of `dittodb`. They have also worked as a data scientist in a number of different industries (identify verification and fraud, market research, call centers, and social justice among other areas) using a wide range of tools to analyze, model, and use data at large enterprise scales. On top of building data tooling, they have a passion for teaching data scientists and others how to use data and tools to do their work and inform their decisions.|
